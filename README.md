crop-detector
=============

Utility that finds cropped image coordinates inside original image.

<b>Work in progress...</b>

Usage
-----

```bash
crop-detector DIFF_THRESHOLD ORIGINAL_IMAGE CROPPED_IMAGE
```

Where:
  - MODE
    - `every-pixel` -
      for check every pixel for diff limit
      (faster than `average` but needs higher diff threshold);
    - `average` -
      for check average value of whole crop-size chunk at position on
      original image (slower but better for JPEG artifacts);
    - Every mode has `perfect-` prefix, by default this app stops when
      found first match, but with `perfect-` prefix it checks all
      possible coordinates and choose better match, in many cases a lot
      slower but gets you some guarantees, possible modes with this prefix:
      - `perfect-every-pixel` -
        it needs additional checking for every pixel match, so it's slower
        than `perfect-average` mode, it's better to use just `perfect-average`;
      - `perfect-average`
  - DIFF_THRESHOLD - Max percent of allowed difference (for JPEG artifacts);
  - ORIGINAL_IMAGE - Path to whole image;
  - CROPPED_IMAGE  - Path to image that is cropped part of ORIGINAL_IMAGE.

Example cmd:
  ```bash
  crop-detector every-pixel 20 ~/Pictures/original.jpg ~/Pictures/cropped.jpg
  ```

Example output: `137 260 201 181`
It's: `x y width height` of cropped image.
